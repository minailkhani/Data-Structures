implement â€ŒB-Tree using my linked-list
then use B-Tree and dijkstra algorithm to solve maze. The origin is at the top of the puzzle and the destination is at the bottom of the puzzle. Positive numbers indicate the path and the difficulty of that path, and 0 indicates the wall
example:
8 10
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0
0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
